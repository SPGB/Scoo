##The Idea

Scoopling in center of screen with "Click ME!" speech bubble. Add-ons appear to his left and right the more he is clicked.

##Purpose

This is mostly a fun show case of material design, Github pages, and a simple incremental

##Feedback

As for UI, is it possible for the bar to change colours from blue to red as it increases? Might help to visually indicate that it is "heating up"... the constant red seems wrong

The bonus multiplier should start hidden. Initially, it should be impossible to get the bar into the bonus box until the first upgrade is purchased (I think it might be that way already). This gives the player a goal to try and reach the bonus box to find out what happens (curiosity/exploration motivation).
 Once they hit the box, another info box should be displayed explaining the bonus as well as showing the bonus multiplier and should help the player learn.

Another idea. I think the bonus box should start small (10%?) but upgrades could increase it's size to the maximum. It could also mean that it would take a few upgrades before the player reaches the box, rather than the 1 upgrade it currently takes.
You could also potentially have upgrades to the bonus box multiplier. Have it start at 1.25X, but can be upgraded up to some maximum amount
